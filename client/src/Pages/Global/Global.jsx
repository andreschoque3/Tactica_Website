The past and current anti-public safety climate in the U.S. has produced high rates of officer suicide, divorce, and dangerously low morale. The launching of TACTICA-USA enables us to actively support U.S. officers and their families. We offer quality tactical and leadership training to departments and officers in need. Our team enthusiastically shares the hope that comes from a personal relationship with Jesus and encourages public safety families to grow in their faith and inter-familial relationships. Recognizing the broad variety of needs in the public safety community, we also minister through family & marriage retreats, help officers and their families heal from PTSD, and partner with local churches to provide events in an effort to see a police community that is healthy at the heart, mind, and soul level."
